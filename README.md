# 📖 RAG Implementation using Groq API

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** built using the **Groq API**.  
It enables answering user queries based on knowledge extracted from **PDF documents**.  
The system demonstrates how large language models can be enhanced with external knowledge sources for more accurate and contextual responses.

## 🛠️ Features
- **PDF Data Ingestion** → Convert raw PDFs into structured chunks for retrieval.  
- **Chunking Process** → Learned the importance of chunking for better context and semantic search.  
- **Vector Database Creation** → Built a **Chroma DB** for efficient storage of embeddings.  
- **FAISS Integration** → Used FAISS for **fast and scalable similarity search**.  
- **Retrieval Pipeline** → Implemented query-based retrieval to fetch relevant context before response generation.  
- **Groq API Integration** → Leveraged Groq’s API key for LLM responses.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained deeper understanding of:
- **Data Ingestion Pipeline** – Converting unstructured PDFs into retrievable knowledge chunks.  
- **Data Retrieval Pipeline** – Building the mechanism to fetch relevant documents.  
- **Chunking Strategy** – Why smaller, overlapping text chunks improve retrieval quality.  
- **Vector Databases** – How **Chroma DB** and **FAISS** are used for efficient storage & similarity search.  
- **RAG Fundamentals** – Combining embeddings, retrieval, and LLMs for better results.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Enhance retrieval with **hybrid search** (semantic + keyword).  
- Add **UI for interactive querying**.  
- Optimize chunk size & overlap for different datasets.
